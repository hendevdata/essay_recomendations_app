# Essay Scorer

This Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for registering and logging in to an essay scoring system. (Note: The current implementation uses a placeholder for user data storage and requires security enhancements before deployment.)

# Key Features:

User Registration: Allows users to create new accounts with usernames and passwords.
Login: Enables registered users to access the essay scoring functionality (not yet implemented in this code).
Running the Application:

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Streamlit installed: pip install streamlit
Run the Script: Execute python essay_scorer.py (replace with your actual script name)
Security Considerations (Important):

The current user storage (users dictionary) is for demonstration purposes only and is NOT secure.
In a real-world application, you must implement a robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL to securely store usernames and hashed passwords using a library like bcrypt or argon2.
Consider additional security measures such as session management and input validation to prevent vulnerabilities.
Future Development:

Implement the essay scoring functionality.
Integrate with external services for essay analysis (optional).
Enhance user interface elements as needed.
